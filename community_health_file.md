## **Overview of Codebuddies**

### What is CodeBuddies?
[CodeBuddies](https://codebuddies.org/) is a remote-first community of independent code learners who enjoy sharing knowledge and helping each other learn faster via discussions and pairing. It is free and open-sourced, and supported by open source contributors and financial backers on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/codebuddies).  

### CodeBuddies website Version 3

We are currently building out a new platform (codebuddies version 3 - cbv3) to replace the [old version](http://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies) which is currently shown at [codebuddies.org]((https://codebuddies.org/)).  

The new version of the website will include features that will help users:
* share and recommend resources/tutorial links
* find open source projects to work on
* form study groups
* collect learning paths and share them
* pair programming -- find 1-hour pair programming partners for any topics in a much more easier ways

## **Role of Backend**
The backend of the CodeBuddies Version 3 website is an app which is composed of Django REST Framework that provides API endpoints which the frontend app (React) consumes.

We have a technical decision log [here](https://github.com/codebuddies/backend/wiki/Decision-log).
