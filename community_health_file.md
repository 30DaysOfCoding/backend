## **Overview of Codebuddies**

### What is CodeBuddies?
[CodeBuddies](https://codebuddies.org/) is a remote-first community of independent code learners who enjoy sharing knowledge and helping each other learn faster via discussions and pairing. It is free and open-sourced, and supported by open source contributors and financial backers on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/codebuddies).  

### CodeBuddies website Version 3 (CBV3)

We are currently building out a new platform (CBV3) to replace the [old version](http://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies) which is currently shown at [codebuddies.org]((https://codebuddies.org/)).  

The new version of the website will include features that will help users:
* share and recommend resources/tutorial links
* find open source projects to work on
* form study groups
* collect learning paths and share them
* pair programming -- find 1-hour pair programming partners for any topics in a much more easier ways

## **Role of Backend**
The backend of CBV3 is an app which is composed of Django REST Framework that provides API endpoints which the frontend app (React) consumes.

We have a technical decision log [here](https://github.com/codebuddies/backend/wiki/Decision-log).

## **Links to Clients / Frontend**
The frontend of CBV3 is built with React and is located at here[http://github.com/codebuddies/frontend].

## **Technology Used**
Components of the CBV3 Backend:
* [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
* [Cookiecutter][https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.0/]

Application Deployment
* [Docker]

Database:
* [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org)
* [DigialOcean Droplets](http://digitalocean.com/products/droplets) to store the database on cloud
