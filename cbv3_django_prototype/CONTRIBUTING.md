### Reporting Bugs

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome enhancement requests, no matter how simple or complex they may be. Before requesting an enhancement we do ask that you have a look through issues tagged `enhancement` to see if your request has been raised already. Please also take a look at this crowdsourced summary of [problems we want to solve](https://pad.riseup.net/p/BecKdThFsevRmmG_tqFa-keep).

Remember, not all features will be implemented. If we've decided not to proceed with an enhancement, we do aim to provide a clear articulation of why the decision was made.
