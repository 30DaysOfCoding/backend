## Code of Conduct

## I have a Question

## Who can Contribute?
### Prerequisites (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
Anyone who has the motivation can contribute to our codebase. Working on improving our documentation is often a great way for less experienced programmers to get started, but at any level the following will eventually be needed for you to have as much fun as possible working with us! If you are not familar with any of these bullet points, consider them a good a learning path.

You will need to be comfortable: 
- using Git to create branches and track changes.
- using the terminal and related commands.
- using Python primitives, datatypes, loops, and decorators: an "advanced beginner". 
- some knowledge of JavaScript--especially JSON.
- some knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- using Django--you should have completed at least one tutorial that covers making a website in Django.
- understand the basic ideas, motivations, and approach behind Test Driven Development. 
- using Docker and docker-compose commands and their config files to bring up a local application.


You need to understand certain concepts: 
- how the internet works
- what a RESTful and API mean, and also what they mean, together.
- What MVC web architecture is.

## How do I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome enhancement requests, no matter how simple or complex they may be. Before requesting an enhancement we do ask that you have a look through issues tagged `enhancement` to see if your request has been raised already. Please also take a look at this crowdsourced summary of [problems we want to solve](https://pad.riseup.net/p/BecKdThFsevRmmG_tqFa-keep).

Remember, not all features will be implemented. If we've decided not to proceed with an enhancement, we do aim to provide a clear articulation of why the decision was made.

## Gitiquette
This section covers the basic building blocks for how to collaborate and contribute to our repository using the power of git.

### Branching

Create a branch before working on an issue. Please follow our branch naming convention: `issue-123-decsription`.

* `issue` - the word 'issue' without quotes
* `123` - the issue number you will be working on
* `description` - a brief (2-3 word) hyphen separated description of what you will do

**Example:** `issue-44-docker-environment`
